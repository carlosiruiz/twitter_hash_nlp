I think it would be most prudent to play  the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively. I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to backs, but commodity spreads). The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for  everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask  John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  Thanks. Jeff'''\n",
